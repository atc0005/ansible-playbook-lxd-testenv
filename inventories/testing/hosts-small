# "Small" inventory file for Ansible testing purposes.
#
# This inventory file intentionally has a smaller list of containers than the
# standard inventory file in order to maximize test environment build-up and
# tear-down speed.
#

# Hosts HAVE to be included in one of the OS groups in order to be
# spun up as a LXD container.
