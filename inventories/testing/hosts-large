# Purpose: Larger set of containers for extended testing purposes.

# See 'hosts-small' for a small set of containers that reflect that latest LTS
# releases for distros in our production fleet.

# See 'hosts' for a slightly smaller number of containers that reflect current
# LTS releases + one release back that is still supported by the vendor.

# NOTE: Hosts HAVE to be included in one of the OS groups in order to be
# spun up as a LXD container.
