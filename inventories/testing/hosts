# "Default" inventory file for Ansible testing purposes.

# Purpose: Reduced set of containers that attempts to balance test environment
# build-up and tear-down speed with common distro versions that are commonly
# found in production environments. See 'hosts-small' for an even smaller set
# of containers and 'hosts-large' for an extended host inventory to test
# against.

# NOTE: Hosts HAVE to be included in one of the OS groups in order to be
# spun up as a LXD container.
